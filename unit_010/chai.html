Clay styled tea cups are nice collector's pieces but are not typically used for drinking chai. <br>Since chai is served very hot you start by holding it at the top nearest the rim. If you ever visit Turkey be prepared to be offered chai any time of the day. Turks are known to drink chai all day long and chai can be found everywhere...even at a barber shop.</article>
